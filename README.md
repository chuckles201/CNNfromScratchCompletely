# CNNfromScratchCompletely
Scratch Convolutional Network designed as with only numpy and math :)
- Scratch Archetecture & Custom Backpropogation/Gradient Descent Engine (Like pytorch)
- 
## Purpose
I've designed this (hopefully) to be as follow-able as possible with plenty of comments and explanations in my code. If anything is unclear, send me a message, and I will try to fix it. With a little work and thinking, you can get a lot out of this rep, as it covers scratch-backpropogation, neural-net archetecture creation, and examining interesting emergent phenomena from neural nets.
